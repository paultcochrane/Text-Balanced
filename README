                  Release of version 1.81 of Text::Balanced
==============================================================================


NAME

    Text::Balanced - Extract delimited text sequences from strings.


SUMMARY (see Balanced.pod for full details)

    Text::Balanced::extract_delimited
    
        `extract_delimited' extracts the initial substring of a string
        which is delimited by a user-specified set of single-character
        delimiters, whilst ignoring any backslash-escaped delimiter
        characters.

    Text::Balanced::extract_bracketed
    
        `extract_bracketed' extracts a balanced-bracket-delimited substring
        (using any one (or more) of the user-specified delimiter brackets:
        '(..)', '{..}', '[..]', or '<..>').
    
    Text::Balanced::extract_quotelike
    
        `extract_quotelike' attempts to recognize and extract any one of the
        various Perl quote and quotelike operators (see "perlop(3)"). Embedded
        backslashed delimiters, nested bracket delimiters (for the
        quotelike operators), and trailing modifiers are all correctly handled.
    
    Text::Balanced::extract_codeblock
    
        `extract_codeblock' attempts to recognize and extract a
        balanced bracket-delimited substring which may also contain
        unbalanced brackets inside Perl quotes or quotelike
        operations. That is, `extract_codeblock' is like a combination
        of `extract_bracketed' and `extract_quotelike'.

    Text::Balanced::extract_tagged
    
        `extract_tagged' attempts to recognize and extract a
        substring between two arbitrary "tag" patterns (a start tag
	and an end tag).

    
INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.81


	- Fixed test count in extract_codeblock.t

	- Fixed improbable bug with trailing ->'s in extract_variable

	- Fixed (HT|X)ML tag extraction in extract_tagged (thanks, Tim)

	- Added explanatory note about prefix matching (thanks again, Tim)

	- Added handling of globs and sub refs to extract_variable

	- Pod tweak (thanks Abigail)

	- Allowed right tags to be run-time evaluated, so
	  extract_tagged($text, '/([a-z]+)', '/end$1') works
	  as expected.

	- Added optional blessing of matches via extract_multiple

	- Fixed bug in autogeneration of closing tags in extract_tagged
	  (Thanks, Coke)

	- Fixed bug in interaction between extract_multiple and
	  gen_extract_tagged (Thanks Anthony)
