Revision history for Perl extension Text::Balanced.

1.00  Mon Aug 11 12:42:56 1997

	- original version


1.01  Mon Sep  8 18:09:18 EST 1997

	- changed "quotemeta" to "quotemeta $_" to work 
	  around bug in Perl 5.002 and 5.003


1.10  Tue Sep 30 17:23:23 EST 1997

	- reworked extract_quotelike to correct handling of some obscure cases


1.21  Sat Oct  4 17:21:54 EST 1997

	- synchronised with Parse::RecDescent distribution (version number
	  will now reflect that package)

1.23  Fri Oct 17 10:26:38 EST 1997

	- changed behaviour in scalar and void contexts. Scalar contexts
	  now return only the extracted string. Void contexts now remove
	  the extracted string from the first argument (or $_).

1.24

	- changed behaviour in scalar contexts. Scalar contexts
	  now return the extracted string _and_ remove it from the
	  first argument (or $_).

	- changed return values on failure (all contexts return undef
	  for invalid return fields)

	- fixed some lurking bugs with trailing modifier handling
	
	- added :ALL tag to simplify wholesale importing of functions

	- fixed serious bug with embedded division operators ("/")
	  This now also allows the ?...? form of pattern matching!

1.35	Wed Jun 24 09:53:31 1998

	- fixed handling of :: quantifiers in extract_variable()

	- numerous trivial lexical changes to make xemacs happy


1.36	Tue Jul 14 12:26:04 1998

	- Reinstated POD file missing from previous distribution

	- Added undocumented fourth parameter to extract_codeblock
	  so as to correctly handle (?) and (s?) modifiers in
	  RecDescent grammars.


1.40	Tue Aug  4 13:54:52 1998

        - Added (optional) handling of embedded quoted text to
          extract_delimited (see revised entry in Balanced.pod)

        - Added extract_tagged which extracts text between arbitrary,
          optionally nested start and end tags (see new entry in
          Balanced.pod).

        - Added delimited_pat which builds a pattern which matches a
          string delimited by any of the delimiters specified (see new
          entry in Balanced.pod).

	- Added test.pl


1.41	Mon Aug 10 14:51:50 1998

	- Reinstated change to extract_codeblock from 1.36 which were
	  mysteriously lost in 1.40


1.50	Thu Aug 27 09:20:19 1998

	- Improved the structure of the regex generated by
	  delimited_pat (and used in extract_delimited). It's
	  considerably more complex, but also more robust and 
	  much faster in the worst case.

	- Altered extract_variable to accept whitespace in variables,
	  e.g. '$ a -> {'b'}     ->  [2]'
